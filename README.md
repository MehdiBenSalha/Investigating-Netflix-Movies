This project aims to analyze a dataset of Netflix movies to gain insights into movie duration, release year, and genre. The dataset includes information such as title, country, genre, release year, and duration of each movie. The analysis involves filtering the dataset to find movies shorter than 60 minutes, visualizing movie duration by release year, and assigning colors to genre groups for visualization. Additionally, the project explores a subset of the dataset to further understand the characteristics of Netflix movies. The ultimate goal is to uncover patterns and trends in Netflix movie data that can provide valuable insights for content creators and viewers alike.
